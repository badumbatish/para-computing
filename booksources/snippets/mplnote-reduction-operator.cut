  The usual reduction operators are given as templated operators:
  %
  \cxxverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/collectscalar.cxx]{mplallreduce}
  %
  Note the parentheses after the operator.
  Also note that the operator comes first, not last.
  \begin{mplimpl}
    The reduction operator is a \lstinline+std::function<T(T,T)>+:
  \end{mplimpl}
