  In MPL, which is based on C++,
  the naive construct would be:
  %
  \cxxverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/commrank.cxx]{mplcommcopy}
  %
  However, if the variable will always correspond to the world communicator,
  it is better to make it \lstinline{const} and declare it to be a reference:
  %
  \cxxverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/commrank.cxx]{mplcommref}
