  MPL routines are templated over the data type.  The data types,
  where MPL can infer their internal representation, are enumeration
  types, C~arrays of constant size and the template classes
  \lstinline+std::array+,
  \lstinline+std::pair+ and
  \lstinline+std::tuple+
  of the C++ Standard Template
  Library. The only limitation is, that the C~array and the mentioned
  template classes hold data elements of types that can be sent or
  received by MPL.
