  The send-recv call in \ac{MPL} has the same possibilities
  for specifying the send and receive buffer as the separate send and recv calls:
  scalar, layout, iterator. However, out of the nine conceivably possible
  routine prototypes, only the versions are available where the send and receive buffer
  are specified the same way.
  Also, the send and receive tag need to be specified; they do not have default values.

  \cxxverbatimsnippet{mplsendrecv}% exercise, so no source
