  The send-recv call in \ac{MPL} has the same possibilities
  for specifying the send and receive buffer as the separate send and recv calls:
  scalar, layout, iterator. However, out of the nine conceivably possible
  routine prototypes, only the versions are available where the send and receive buffer
  are specified the same way.

  \cxxverbatimsnippet{mplsendrecv}% exercise, so no source
