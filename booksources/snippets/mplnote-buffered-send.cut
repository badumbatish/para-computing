  Creating and attaching a buffer is done through \indexmpldef{bsend_buffer}
  and a support routine \indexmpldef{bsend_size} helps in calculating
  the buffer size:
  \cxxverbatimsnippet{bsendbufmpl}

  Constant: \lstinline+mpl::+\indexmplshow{bsend_overhead} is \lstinline{constexpr}'d
  to the MPI constant \indexmpishow{MPI_BSEND_OVERHEAD}.
