This chapter explains the basic concepts of
\ac{CAF}, and helps you get
started on running your first program.

\Level 0 {History and design}

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarray_Fortran}

\Level 0 {Compiling and running}

\ac{CAF} is built on the same \ac{SPMD} design as MPI.
Where MPI talks about processes or ranks, \ac{CAF}
calls the running instances of your program \indextermdef{image}s.

The Intel compiler uses the flag \n{-coarray=xxx}
with values \n{single}, \n{shared}, \n{distributed} \n{gpu}.

It is possible to bake the number of `images' into the executable,
but by default this is not done, and it is determined at runtime
by the variable \n{FOR_COARRAY_NUM_IMAGES}.

\ac{CAF} can not be mixed with OpenMP.

\Level 0 {Basics}

Co-arrays are defined by giving them, in addition to the \lstinline{Dimension},
a \indextermttdef{Codimension}

\begin{lstlisting}
Complex,codimension(*) :: number
Integer,dimension(:,:,:),codimension[-1:1,*] :: grid  
\end{lstlisting}

This means we are respectively declaring
an array with a single number on each image,
or a three-dimensional grid spread over a two-dimensional processor grid.

Traditional-like syntax can also be used:
\begin{lstlisting}
Complex :: number[*]
Integer :: grid(10,20,30)[-1:1,*]
\end{lstlisting}

Unlike \ac{MPI}, which normally only supports a linear process numbering,
\ac{CAF} allows for multi-dimensional process grids. The last dimension
is always specified as~\n{*}, meaning it is determined at runtime.

\Level 1 {Image identification}

As in other models, in \ac{CAF} one can ask how many images/processes there are,
and what the number of the current one is,
with \indextermttdef{num_images} and \indextermttdef{this_image} respectively.

\fverbatimsnippet[examples/caf/f08/hello.F90]{hellocaf}

If you call \indextermtt{this_image} with a co-array as argument,
it will return the image index, as a tuple of \indextermttdef{cosubscript}s,
rather than a linear index.
Given such a set of subscripts, \indextermttdef{image_index}
will return the linear index.

The functions \indextermttdef{lcobound} and \indextermttdef{ucobound}
give the lower and upper bound on the image subscripts,
as a linear index, or a tuple if called with a co-array variable.

\Level 1 {Remote operations}

The appeal of \ac{CAF} is that moving data between images
looks (almost) like an ordinary copy operation:
\begin{lstlisting}
real :: x(2)[*]
integer :: p
p = this_image()
x(1)[ p+1 ] = x(2)[ p ]
\end{lstlisting}

Exchanging grid boundaries is elegantly done with array syntax:
\begin{lstlisting}
Real,Dimension( 0:N+1,0:N+1 )[*] :: grid
grid( N+1,: )[p] = grid( 0,: )[p+1]
grid(   0,: )[p] = grid( N,: )[p-1]
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 1 {Synchronization}

The fortran standard forbids \indexterm{race condition}s:
\begin{quote}
  If a variable is defined on an image in a segment, it shall not be
  referenced, defined or become undefined in a segment on another
  image unless the segments are ordered.
\end{quote}
That is, you should not cause them to happen. The language and runtime
are certainly not going to help yu with that.

Well, a little. After remote updates you can synchronize images
with the \indextermttdef{sync} call.
The easiest variant is a global synchronization:
\begin{lstlisting}
sync all
\end{lstlisting}
Compare this to a wait call after MPI nonblocking calls.

More fine-grained, one can synchronize with specific images:
\begin{lstlisting}
sync images( (/ p-1,p,p+1 /) )
\end{lstlisting}
While remote operations in \ac{CAF} are nicely one-sided,
synchronization is not:
if image \n{p} issues a call
\begin{lstlisting}
sync(q)
\end{lstlisting}
then \n{q} also needs to issue a mirroring call to synchronize with~\n{p}.

As an illustration, the following code is not a correct implementation of a 
\indexterm{ping-pong}:
%
\fverbatimsnippet{ppwrongcaf}

We can solve this with a global synchronization:
%
\fverbatimsnippet{ppcafglob}
%
or a local one:
%
\fverbatimsnippet{ppcafloc}
%
Note that the local sync call is done on both images involved.

Example of how you would synchronize a collective:
\begin{lstlisting}
if ( this_image() .eq. 1 ) sync images( * )
if ( this_image() .ne. 1 ) sync images( 1 )
\end{lstlisting}
Here image~1 synchronizes with all others, but the others don't
synchronize with each other.

\Level 1 {Collectives}

Collectives are not part of \ac{CAF} as of the 2008 Fortran standard.
