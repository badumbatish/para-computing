\Level 0 {Communicators}

PETSc has a `world' communicator, which by default equals
\lstinline{MPI_COMM_WORLD}. If you want to run PETSc on a subset of processes,
you can assign a subcommunicator to the variable \lstinline{PETSC_COMM_WORLD}
in between the calls to \indexmpishow{MPI_Init} and
\indexpetscshow{PetscInitialize}.
Petsc communicators are of type \indexpetscdef{PetscComm}.

\endinput

\Level 0 {Scalars}
\label{sec:petsc-scalar}

The definition of
\indexpetscdef{PetscInt}, \indexpetscdef{PetscReal}, \indexpetscdef{PetscComplex}
depends on how PETSc was installed.
This makes interoperability with other libraries such as
\emph{MPI}%
a little tricky.

The equivalent \indexpetscshow{MPI_Datatype} values are
\indexpetscdef{PetscMPIInt}
\indexpetscdef{MPIU_INT}
\indexpetscdef{MPIU_REAL}
\indexpetscdef{MPIU_SCALAR}
\indexpetscdef{MPIU_COMPLEX}

Similarly, for the
\emph{BLAS}%
library there  are:
%
\indexpetscdef{PetscBLASInt}

No real types are needed since these are passed by reference.
